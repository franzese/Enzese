# Hi I'm Ricky üëã

This repo houses my personal site - www.enzese.com - it links to my professional profiles, a form to contact me, and my r√©sum√©.

If you're looking for my r√©sum√© you can click <a href="">here</a>

If you want to check out this repo to get an understanding about what kind of applications I write, I'm afraid this project is too small to be impressive - but - here's what it's build on top of:

-   Three.js - a customized demo is running in the background to make things fun
-   Node + Express.js - the backend app server which
-   Vanilla ES5 - There's nothing really difficult about laying out some links in the HTML, so no framework was used
-   CS3 - For some cool fade-in animations, tricky opacity masks, and gridless responsive positioning
